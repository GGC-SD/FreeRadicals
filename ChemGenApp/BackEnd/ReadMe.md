Future locations for installation of backed instructions.

This is almost the same as what was done in the tutorial that was shown in the "Coding the Smart Way" thing, section 2.

I'll go through and add this at a later date.  Most likely when I realize I don't remember how to do it when I try to install everything onto the test branch.
It's currently 2:43 am, and I don't really want to do it right now.  Hungry and tired.
