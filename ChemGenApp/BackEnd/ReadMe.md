# Installation of Backend Instructions

## Notes
Please note that this is subject to change, as we may need more stuff to be installed on the backend later

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the Backend folder
2. run npm install babel-cli@6.26.0 
3. run npm install babel-preset-env@1.7.0
4. run npm install babel-watch@2.0.7
5. run npm install express@4.16.3
6. run npm install cors@2.8.4
 - This is where the tutorial installed mongoose, which I did not, as I did not see the reason. As we are not using a database at the current time.
 - As a reference, the command for that would be npm install mongoose
7. run npm run dev

This should start the backend server on localhost:4000
