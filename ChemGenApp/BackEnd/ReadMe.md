**Installation of Backend Instructions

**Notes

Please note that this is subject to change, as we may need more stuff to be installed on the backend later

**Instructions

1. Navigate to the Backend folder
2. run npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-env
3. run npm install --save-dev babel-watch
4. run npm install express
 - This is where the tutorial installed cors and mongoose, which I did not, as I did not see the reason.  As we are not using a database at the current time.
 - As a reference, the commands for that would be npm install mongoose and npm install cors
5. run npm run dev

This should start the backend server on localhost:4000
