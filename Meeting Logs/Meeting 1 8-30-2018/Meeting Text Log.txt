Program REQUIREMENTS (NECESSARY):

1. Multiple formats
2. Student use using random viable inputs.
	- This is sortof like the original idea.  Where someone go online and answers questions
3. Significant figures might be nice to work on.
	- important, but can wait

Notes:
* Focus on meeting the requirements. Appearance and additional functions come last.
* Prepare a good meeting time for next week so that it is reliable for everyone.
* Use preliminary code from the professor to help.
* He suggested the use of TextWrangler, but it seems to be a Mac program
* TRY to document everything.
* Doesn't need to be pretty, but needs to be formatted and useable, pretty comes later.

Next Week Goals:
* We need a sort of step by step goal sheet for the project
* Timelines, benchmarks, goals, all needed.

Timeline/Goals:
1. Translate via program
2. Decipher and Document
3. Edit and Document
